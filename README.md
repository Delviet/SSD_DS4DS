## Description

This is a non-commercial project, which aims to simplify deep learning research and reproducibility. One of the current research bottlenecks is in the Experiment stage, during which researchers usually spend a lot of time on re-implementation of the models from the other researches. Two usual reasons are the lack of the public access code and the non-portability of the code. 

This project aims to overcome those problems with the use of containerization and distributed (volunteer) computing. 

At the current stage, we propose naive distributed computing for the single fully-connected MNIST model. Anyone may find it's weights [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RPHU1Ft1Owk8Kqi-aJAFh1pOTVDrxQZB/view?usp=sharing).

## Further steps

- [ ] Use ONNX for the Computer-Processor communication  
- [ ] Implement reliable distributed computation  
- [ ] Change the architecture, adding the Resource Manager
