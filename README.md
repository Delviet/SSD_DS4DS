## Description

This is a non-commercial project, which aims to simplify deep learning research and reproducibility. One of the current research bottlenecks is in the Experiment stage, during which researchers usually spend a lot of time on re-implementation of the models from the other researches. Two usual reasons are the lack of the public access code and the non-portability of the code. 

This project aims to overcome those problems with the use of containerization and distributed (volunteer) computing.
